# tdf - test data find

This is a simple utility to find test files regardless of what the
current working directory within the project is.  It will look between
your current working directory and your home directory.

This makes the obvious assumption that you are indeed running the
tests within your home directory.  If this doesn't work for you and
you have a suggestion to how it should be done, feel free to send me a
pull request.
